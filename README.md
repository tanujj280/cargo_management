The project explores how AVL trees, a type of self-balancing binary search tree, can be applied to manage and optimize cargo allocation for starships. 
The idea is to design a system where cargo items, each with attributes such as weight, priority, or type, are stored and managed efficiently using the properties of an AVL tree.
